## Does Charlie Work from Home?

In mid-march 2020, as COVID-19 cases surged across the United States, millions of Americans lost their jobs and even many of those fortunate enough to keep their jobs were suddenly instructed to begin working from home. Commutes abruptly contracted in length from several miles to a few footsteps from the bedroom to the kitchen table. 

As a result, public transportation traffic dropped precipitously. Ridership on buses, trains, and trolleys did not, however, come to a grinding halt. As most of us hunkered down for the long haul, countless essential workers continued their jobs in person and kept society functioning. 

In Boston, MA, after Gov. Baker issued a stay-at-home order on March 24th, employment levels dropped by over 25%, while traffic on the 'heavy-rail' rapid transit lines of the MBTA, collectively known was 'the T', dropped by close to 90%. Mouse-over the chart on the right to explore the effects of the pandemic on employment and MBTA ridership.

These headlines however, don't tell the full story. Not all socioeconomic strata suffered the same levels of job loss, and similarly not all neighborhoods could afford to work from home. Keep scrolling for a graphical exploration of these intertwined stories.

In order to understand how income inequality manifested itself in patterns of MBTA ridership during the pandemic, we must first determine how income varies along the various lines and branches of the T.

Stop 1 along our journey: The official MBTA rapid transit map, which includes information about bus, commuter rail, light-rail, and heavy-rail connections.

The MBTA releases daily gated station validation counts - i.e. the number of people entering a station through its electronic turnstiles - for most of the stations on the four 'heavy-rail' rapid transit lines. These include the Red line (Ashmont/Mattapan and Braintree branches), the Orange line, the Blue line, and the four (B,C,D,E) branches of the Green line. 

The streamlined map on the right is closer to what we need to correlate income with MBTA stations, but it should come as no surprise to anyone who's ridden the T, that the straight lines on the map are in-fact geographically-distorted.

The geographically-accurate tracks look more like this, bending their way under, over, and around the area's streets, rivers, and famously, one of it's colleges. Its true form is a far cry from the tidy lines we're used to seeing on the official map - which are in turn inspired by the infamous re-design of the London Underground Tube map in 1931 by Harry Beck.

This view, however, makes it apparent exactly how far West and South the D-branch of the Green line and the Red line service respectively.

Overlaying the geographically-accurate tracks onto a map of median household income in the Boston area, allows us to start identifying regions of low and high income neighborhoods along the MBTA lines. 

Each shaded region corresponds to an official census tract, with Green corresponding to higher income, and brown corresponding to lower income. Census tracts with missing median household income values are colored black.

We are now ready to put it all together.

The interactive graphic on the right explores the ridership and median household income as a snapshot in time for different tracks. Take a moment to slide the time-slider and see how MBTA ridership changed during the pandemic. The vertical bars encode the seasonally-adjusted drop in ridership, with the gray bars indicating missing station data and providing a pre-pandemic baseline.
